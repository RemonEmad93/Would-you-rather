# MyReads Project

The user can add question, vote on question and view question's score. Firstly, the user must login to be able to access the web app. The home page is the main page where the user can view the lists of answered and unanswered questions. Furthermore, the navbar allow the user to logout, add question and view the leaderboard. All the questions are MCQ and the user should choose one of the two answers. This also means that the user should write only two choices when adding new question. When viewing question's score, the user answer will be colored in blue. The leaderboard shows the number of questions answered and added by each user and the sum of them.
